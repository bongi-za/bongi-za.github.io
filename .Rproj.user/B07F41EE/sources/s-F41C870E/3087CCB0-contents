title: About
---

I live in little old Johannesburg, South Africa. and I'm a PhD student studying sprint biomechanics at the University of Pretoria. Some things I currently like / am interested in:

- Running fast [not myself, obviously]
- Running slowly [mm better]
- Reading
- Writing
- Rocking chairs
- Log cabins
- Coffee
- Moving to unusual and off track places

I sort of just want to live in a log cabin in Argentina. Why not? Besides, I'm planning to peak at 63, so I'm only in a general preparation phase.

Research interests:

Currently I'm mainly interested in coordination as related to complex movements and motor learning, I've especially enjoyed the theoretical aspects of those fields in recent years. I've previously been involved with work on muscle physiology and sleep. Generally, I'm most drawn to more mechanistic fields and enjoy the interface of theory and practise.

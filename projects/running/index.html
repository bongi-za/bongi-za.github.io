<p>I have, by now, been running for almost 6 years, cosying up to 17 000 kms. One of the treats of running is as an act of exploration. To explore on foot places you are visiting, a reason to go to a particular place, and to explore closer to home - the area you live. But now I also am a big old fan of maps, especially satellite numbers, so I wanted to try plot a heatmap sort of thing from all the many running routes new and repeated, and since I am not a Strava man I figured I&rsquo;d try do it in R as a bit of a learning project.</p>
<p>As it happens, getting all my .gpx and route and workout files from the many different places I had recorded them over the years (Notebooks, MapMyRun, TomTom, Suunto, and so on) was rather difficult. Each platform has its own challenges, but the main one is that they don&rsquo;t like to allow you to mass export your files from their platforms. I know there are webscraping and API yada yadas that you can do this with but most of the guides I found to navigate all that were older and no longer on the money or way above my peanut brain and I didn&rsquo;t ever manage to get them working. So I settled for a nice little app called <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nl.appyhapps.healthsync&amp;hl=en_ZA&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1">Health Sync</a> which more or less slowly worked through all my files on each different platform, exporting them to a Google Drive backup.</p>
<p>So well since I had files from a few different places and formats etc I just did the simplest thing for my purposes which was to extract the latitude and longitude for each run with a token ID marker (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LfQ2T6YJ7ugUSHVJ9-J5VefQF9ZYPOF0/view?usp=sharing">data</a>). It turns out the map code itself was fairly simple in either R or Python (<a href="https://github.com/byrondonaldson/byrondonaldson/tree/main/Running%20Map">code for both here</a>) with <code>leaflet</code> and <code>folium</code>. I doubt my silly ass found the optimum solution but it worked well enough to load a base map projection (I like satellite maps so <code>Esri.WorldImagery</code> is a treat, but there are a bunch available. See <a href="https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/">https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/</a>) and then use a simple for loop to add all the running routes and export the map as an html. With the number of data points getting a little high (&gt; 3 milion) the main obstacle was actually just the processing speed and keeping my little old laptop from crashing, which Python seemed to handle a little better. Of course, <code>leaflet</code> and <code>folium</code> can add points and markers and tooltips and so on but for my purposes for the time being that was all a little unnecessary. So it goes.</p>
<p>Anyways, look, a map with all the routes my feet have had the privilege:</p>

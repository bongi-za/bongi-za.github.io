<p>I have, by now, been running for almost 6 years, cosying up to 17 000 kms. One of the treats of running is as an act of exploration. To explore on foot places you are visiting, a reason to go to a particular place, and to explore closer to home - the area you live. But now I also am a big old fan of maps, especially satellite numbers, so I wanted to try plot a heatmap sort of thing from all the many running routes new and repeated, and since I am not a Strava man I figured I&rsquo;d try do it in R as a bit of a learning project.</p>
<p>As it turns out, the mapping part of things isn&rsquo;t too difficult and the real challenge was getting all my .gpx and route and workout files from the many different places I had recorded them over the years (Notebooks, MapMyRun, TomTom, Suunto, and so on). Each platform has its own challenges, but the main one is that they don&rsquo;t like to allow you to mass export your files from their platforms. I know there are webscraping and API yada yadas that you can do this with but most of the guides I found to go this route were older and no longer on the money and I didn&rsquo;t ever manage to get these things working so I settled for a nice little app called HealthSync which more or less slowly worked through all my files on each different platform, exporting them to a Google Drive backup.</p>
<p>So well then without getting extravagant with files in different formats I extracted the latitude and longitude from each gpx file with some ID marker for each run (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LfQ2T6YJ7ugUSHVJ9-J5VefQF9ZYPOF0/view?usp=sharing">data</a>). With that, <code>leaflet</code> makes things pretty simple to actually make the map (<a href="https://github.com/byrondonaldson/byrondonaldson/tree/main/Running%20Map">code</a>). There are a whole bunch of map projections available (see <a href="https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/">https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/</a>) and it can make a neat toggle thing between a few of them, but I&rsquo;m a satellite man myself so I like <code>Esri.WorldImagery</code>, and the dark maps are cool too. Anyhow, It&rsquo;s unlikely to be the most effective or elegant solution but after a bit of playing I settled on using a for loop to go through all the runs by ID and add them to the base map projection. And then you can export it as a nice little html file for full screen fun in the browser.</p>
<p><img src="/images/map_code_python.png"  alt="Python code" /></p>
<p>Of course, when the number/distance of runs starts to get reasonably high then the number of data points creeps towards the larger end (&gt; 3 million) and things can be intensive processing-wise, at least for my machine, and the output a little slow to load on dodgy connections. <code>leaflet</code> can add points and markers and tooltips and so on but for my purposes for the time being that was all a little unnecessary. So it goes.</p>
<p>Anyways, look, a map with all the routes my feet have had the privilege:</p>

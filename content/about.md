title: About
---

I'm a PhD student in Sprint Biomechanics at the University of Pretoria, supervised by [Helen Bayne](https://www.helenbayne.com/) and [Neil Bezodis](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/n.e.bezodis/). 

Research interests:

Currently I'm mainly interested in kinematics, coordination and technique in complex movements. I've previously been involved with work on muscle physiology and sleep. Generally, I like theoretical and mechanistic sort of stuff.
